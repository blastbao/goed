## GoEd 
Terminal based code/text editor

It's currently in the "prototyping" state and barely usable, there is a lot of prototype code that is meant to be replaced and many features yet to be developed.

The end goal is to be powerful yet easy to use.

One of the main source of inspiration is Acme, however it will be more configurable and less mouse reliant.

That is not to say it will necessarely be "keyboard only" and it won't rely on "modes" as Vi and Emacs do.
