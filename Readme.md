## GoEd 
Terminal based code/text editor

It's currently in the "prototyping" state and barely usable, there is a lot of 
prototype code that is meant to be replaced and many features yet to be developed.

The end goal is to be powerful yet easy to use.

One of the main source of inspiration is Acme, however it will be more 
configurable and less mouse reliant.

That is not to say it will be "keyboard only" ant it will likely not rely on 
"modes" as Vi and Emacs do.
